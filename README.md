## About
Hi there, It's Muhammet. Who is trying hard to become a data scientist. Nothing is going to be easy for anyone, but something could be more challenging for someone. Probably most of you feel like me.

Anyway, I'll try to tell you my story about why and how I decided to become a data scientist. While I was studying industrial engineering, ı was interested in back-and-development and operational research subjects. I know they don't seem similar, but these are the days I like to spend my time there. In back-end development, probably, I'd done a lot of things (let me explain my experience: creating a relational database and connecting with API servers, creating basic websites with ready bootstrapping, and publishing some temple e-commerce websites for assessments), but most of them weren't enjoyable after a few projects. Because these were killing my creativity. And then, in my last year of university, I focused on my degree, and I was enjoying static. At that time, I decided to become a data scientist. Because it was relevant to coding, optimisation, math, and so on. Over the past 3 years, I have worked as a production engineer at a factory. Then I decided to go to Australia to improve my English. And now I have come back to my country and fully focused on my goal.
Every stage of my life taught me something, and I learned that I was never going to be late for anything. 

Thanks for taking the time to read my story. 

And for understanding. Because probably most of my code blocks and my comments on the project would be wrong. Please keep in mind that I'm still learning with you. Happy learning! Enjoy your journey!



# Projects

* Time_Series_Forecasting_With_Prophet
In this Project, we've worked on the "store sales" dataset, which is sales data for the Ecuador retail brand. And the dataset includes different sheets. In Project, we focused on the train.csv dataset. The train.csv dataset includes id, date, store number, family (the main category for sales), sales (sales price), and onpromotion columns. Before training our model, we prepared our dataset for the Prophet model.And we made prediction with our model.

* EverythingonLinearRegression
Hello everyone,
In this project,I tried to predict house prices with a linear regression model using the California house Price dataset. And in addition, I left additional resources on how we should evaluate the assumptions if our data were suitable for the model.Since the data we had was not very suitable for the linear model, our model did not work very efficiently. But my purpose here was to show step by step the process required to create a linear regression model from raw data to model.

* Credit Card Fraud Decection Binary Classification
I used the "creditcardfraud" data set in this project. I have developed a model that decides whether the transaction is fraud or a legit transaction using the Logistic Regression model, which is the Binary Classification methods.
